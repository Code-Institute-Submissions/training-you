            <h2>How We Can Help</h2>
            <p>It is often believe that in dog training, we are only training the dog. 
               Here at Training You it is all about teaching the handler, giving you the tricks and tools to teach your dog how to be the best version of themselves.
            Well done on making it this far in your quest to have a better understanding of how to work with your dog and meet their needs. With 10 years of experience handling different dog breeds with many different needs, I am inviting you to contact me for a consultation, where I will give you an idea of a training plan. I look forward to hearing from you!

            <h2>How We Train</h2>
            <p>We train using positive reinforcement methods.
                We do not use adversive methods with your dog, as studies have proven that this can hinder learning and weaken the relationship between the handler and dog. By using positive reinforcement methods, you are minimizing the chance of your dog having a bad experience and increasing the enthusiasm to learn new skills.</p>
